## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
# Twitter API
create_token(
  app = "Project727",
  consumer_key = "9QNMbZyUIoD0PhIX8ucEqqILp",
  consumer_secret = "qBoORiu2VgDJAXHqceq24XJzmLyfq5ktwXXAI06n98uhQ3HJCk",
  access_token = "1188871434740862976-JhfoMtGIvOs0S7WcnLov0A5VgzlUle",
  access_secret = "VriQtJZRAeWi2x8m6WrZoEAxpCWn5ROoNqInujL4M379d"
)

```

Get token

```{r}
get_token()

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
no_1631 <- search_fullarchive ("#NoOn1631",n = 100, env_name = "Dev2",fromDate ="201810010000",toDate = "201811080000")
no_1631
```
