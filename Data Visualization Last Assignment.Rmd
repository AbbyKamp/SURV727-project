## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
# Twitter API - Not to run for assignment
create_token(
  app = "Project727",
  consumer_key = "",
  consumer_secret = "",
  access_token = "",
  access_secret = ""
)

```

Get token

```{r}
#Not to run for assignment
get_token()

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
#Not to run for assignment
no_1631 <- search_fullarchive ("#NoOn1631",n = 100, env_name = "Dev2",fromDate ="201810010000",toDate = "201811080000")
no_1631
```

```{r}
#Not to run for assignment
save_as_csv(no_1631,"no_1.csv",prepend_ids = TRUE, na = "",fileEncoding = "UTF-8") 
```

```{r}
#Not to run for assignment
no_1631_2 <- search_fullarchive ("#NoOn1631", n = 500, env_name = "Dev2", fromDate ="201810010000",toDate = "201811080000")
no_1631_2
```

```{r}
#Not to run for assignment
save_as_csv(no_1631,"no_2.csv",prepend_ids = TRUE, na = "",fileEncoding = "UTF-8") 
```
