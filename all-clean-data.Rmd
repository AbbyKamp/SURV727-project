First, we load in all of our packages.

```{r}
library(rtweet)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(readr)
library(rjson)
library(ggmap)

citation("ggmap")

```

Then we load in all of our data files. These files were downloaded from TWitter and the Washington Secretary of State webpage and saved as CSVs. 
```{r}

setwd("~/Desktop/Twitter")

#uploading tweet data
tweets <- read_csv("tweets.csv")

#uploading user data pulled from the tweet data
 users <- read_csv("twitter-users.csv")

#importing voting reuslts
votes <- read_csv("washington-2018-results.csv")
head(votes)

#uploading list of cities in washington to match with user information
cities <- read_csv("washington-cities.csv")
```

## Twitter users vs. voters map

We need to clean the twitter users data and the city file to create a county location for all twitter users. 

```{r}
#we drop the NAs
users2 <-
  users %>%
   select(user_id, location, screen_name) %>%
   drop_na(.)

#seperate the location column into city and state
users2 <- separate(users2, location, into = c("city","state"), sep= (","))

#get rid of all the white space
users2 <-
users2 %>%
  select(user_id, screen_name, city) %>%
  mutate(city = tolower(trimws(.$city)))

#then we need to clean the cities data
colnames(cities)[1] <- "city"
colnames(cities)[2] <- "county"

cities <-
cities %>%
  mutate(city = tolower(trimws(.$city, "l")))

cities$city <- (gsub("\\s", "", cities$city))

#then we merge the dataframes
full_location <- merge(users2, cities, by = "city")

#reordering city variables
full_location <-
full_location %>%
  select(user_id, screen_name, city, county)

```

Then we combine the twitter user data with the tweets file, so that we have the location for all tweets were location was provided. (Twitter does not require users to disclose their location.)

```{r}
#annoyingly full_location has an extra x in the user id so need to remove
full_location$user_id <- gsub("x", "", full_location$user_id)
tweets$user_id <- gsub("x", "", tweets$user_id)

#merge user location with actual tweets
tweets_location <-
  tweets %>%
  select(user_id, screen_name, text, is_retweet, favorite_count,
         reply_count, retweet_count, hashtags, followers_count) 

#something weird is happening when I merge and I don't know why
online_users <- merge(tweets_location, full_location, by = "user_id")
 
```

We need to do some basic cleaning of the votes data so that we only have information on the 1631 referendum.

```{r}
votes <-
  votes %>%
  select(County, Race, Candidate, Votes, PercentageOfTotalVotes) %>%
  filter(Race == "State Measures Initiative Measure No. 1639 Initiative Measure No. 1639 concerns firearms.")

```


```{r}
#Mapping the voting data
#i use the ggmap package for this map
state = c(left = -124.84, bottom = 45.54,right = -116.92, top = 49.0)

map <- get_stamenmap(state, zoom = 7, maptype = "toner-lite") %>% ggmap()
map

#trying to plot the voter data
votes %>%
  filter(Candidate == "Yes") %>%
  qmplot(state)
```

```{r}

```

```{r}

```

```{r}
